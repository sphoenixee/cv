                Poetry teaches me how to pay attention to the world. My work
                explores the interdependence between nature, human beings, and
                all things. I mostly write haiku, tanka, and related forms. My
                work has been widely published in journals and anthologies,
                including
                <i><a href="https://www.tankasocietyofamerica.org/ribbons">Ribbons</a></i>,
                <a href="http://www.hsa-haiku.org/frogpond/"><i>Frogpond</i></a>, and <a
